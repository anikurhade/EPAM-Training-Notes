Q: What is version control?
A: Version control is the process of managing and tracking changes to a codebase or document over time. It allows developers to collaborate on projects, keep track of changes, and roll back to previous versions if necessary.

Q: What are the benefits of using version control?
A: Using version control provides several benefits, including:

   1. Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same codebase at the same time without interfering with each other's work.
   2. History tracking: All changes to the codebase are tracked and can be viewed and rolled back if necessary.
   3. Experimentation: Developers can create branches to test out new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.
   4. Accountability: Developers are accountable for their changes and can see who made changes to the codebase and when.
   5.  Backup and recovery: The codebase is backed up in case of data loss or corruption.

Q: What are the different types of version control systems?
A: There are two main types of version control systems: centralized and distributed.
  Centralized version control systems (CVCS) have a central server that stores the codebase and manages changes. Developers check out code from the server to make changes and check it back in when they are finished. Examples of CVCS include Subversion and Perforce.
 Distributed version control systems (DVCS) have a copy of the codebase on each developer's machine. Developers can make changes locally and then push those changes to a central server. Examples of DVCS include Git and Mercurial.

Q: What is a commit in version control?
A: A commit is a snapshot of changes to the codebase. When a developer makes changes to the codebase, they can group those changes into a commit and add a message describing the changes. Commits are tracked and can be viewed and rolled back if necessary.

Q: What is a branch in version control?
A: A branch is a separate line of development in the codebase. Developers can create branches to experiment with new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. Once the changes in a branch are tested and approved, they can be merged back into the main codebase.

Q: What is a merge in version control?
A: A merge is the process of combining changes from one branch into another. When a branch is ready to be merged back into the main codebase, the changes in the branch are combined with the changes in the main codebase. If there are conflicts between the two sets of changes, the developer must resolve them before the merge can be completed.

Q: What is a pull request in version control?
A: A pull request is a way for developers to review and discuss changes before they are merged into the main codebase. When a developer creates a branch and makes changes, they can create a pull request to ask for feedback and approval before the changes are merged. Other developers can review the changes and provide feedback, and the original developer can make any necessary changes before the pull request is merged.

All GiT Commands :- 
There are many Git commands and sub-commands. Here is a list of some of the most commonly used ones:

    git init: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
    git clone: Copies a Git repository from a remote server to the local machine.
    git add: Adds changes to the staging area, preparing them for committing.
    git commit: Commits changes to the repository, creating a new snapshot of the codebase.
    git push: Sends committed changes to a remote repository.
    git pull: Retrieves changes from a remote repository and merges them into the local codebase.
    git status: Displays the status of the local codebase, showing which files have been modified, added, or deleted.
    git log: Displays a log of all commits in the repository, including the commit message, author, and timestamp.
    git branch: Lists all branches in the repository, and creates, deletes, or renames branches.
    git checkout: Switches between branches or commits.
    git merge: Merges changes from one branch into another.
    git diff: Displays the differences between two versions of a file or between two branches.
    git stash: Temporarily stores changes that are not yet ready to be committed.
    git reset: Reverts the repository to a previous commit.
    git remote: Manages connections to remote repositories.
    git fetch: Retrieves changes from a remote repository but does not merge them into the local codebase.
    git tag: Adds tags to specific commits in the repository, allowing for easier reference later on.
